# Celeritas Dynamic Lights

## Fork of SodiumDynamicLights for Celeritas on 1.12.2
### You need cleanroom loader to run this mod

Despite the name, this mod is **not exclusive to Celeritas**. It works on its own, but for best performance, use it with a mod that supports **deferred chunk updates**, such as:

- **Celeritas**
- **Nothirium**
- **Stellar Core** *(make sure "Always defer chunk updates" is enabled in its config)*

### Special Thanks

- **Txni** – for the original SodiumDynamicLights
- **Embeddedt** – for creating Celeritas and thus giving me the motivation to make this port
